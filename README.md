Created by Forrester Hinds for CST8284: Object Oriented Programming - Java at Algonquin College. This Assignment was due on

# Company-Management-Tool-Prototype
A Company Management Tool Prototype I initially developed for my CST8284 Object Oriented Programming class at Algonquin College. 
I since made some usability changes to the code to make the program more user-friendly. Includes a Junit test script which was required 
on assignment submission.


PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Develop a tool to keep track of a Company’s employees. The Company Management Prototype will be able to add employees, list employees, 
and determine which employee has been employed at the Company for the longest period. Each employee’s data will be stored in an Employee 
array (set maximum size for now to be 10). Every employee will have a name, an employee number, a start employment date (day, month, year)
and an annual salary.

TESTING DESIGN

 CompanyConsole contains a main method, which instantiates one Company reference and calls menu().

 NOTE 1: Only CompanyConsole interacts with the user; no other classes should use Scanner or println (etc.).

 NOTE 2: Do not use recursion for your method calls – instead use a properly coded repetition structure. You will lose marks if
recursion is used

 NOTE 3: Do not use any kind of “go-to” statement such as continue, break, System.exit(0), etc… in order to implement program
logic. Instead, use a properly coded control structure and test for continuity or true/false conditions with a boolean
expression. You will lose marks if any “go-to” statements are used. Appropriate places for “break” statements
include using them in a “switch” selection structure.

Learning Outcomes: Optimal design strategies, UML diagram interpretation. Arrays, Composition, JUnit, overriden methods toString() and 
equals().
